										<h1>Research Project</h1>

									<h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
									<p>
									I worked as a research assistant in the Computer Systems Engineering Technology department at the Oregon Institute of Technology. I was given two choices of research project and decided to choose one focused on higher education recruitment.
									The project consisted of creating six word clouds for six computing majors at OIT and having students participate in a web game. In this web game, students matched up the word clouds to the computing major. My motivation behind this was a personal one
									since I had changed majors in my sophmore year due to not understanding what my previous major entailed.
									</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Results</h2>
									<p>
									We had a total of 26 participants out of a total 97 recruited.  Students who participated had the most difficult time distinguishing majors that were within the same department. For example,
									The Computer Systems Engineering Technology Department had three of the six majors and were the lowest scores at 27%, 23% and 38%. This is compared to other majors such as applied mathematics with a score of 73%.
									This showed me that computing majors within one department are most difficult for students to distinguish due to many overlapping courses that translate to the word clouds as overlapping words.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Significance</h2>
									<p>
									Since students have difficulty distinguishing similar majors, I have determined a course of action to alleviate this. Course descriptions should use laymen terms that incoming students understand rather than complex words that only those who have taken the courses understand.
									Course Descriptions should also have as few overlapping terms as possible. The issue with this approach is that many majors have overlapping courses which make it difficult to limit the number of overlapping terms.

										<h1>Junior Project</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/JuniorProject.png" alt="Junior Project Title" /></span>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
									<p>
									My Junior Project invovled going through IRB, creating and deploying a survey for the Wellness Committee at OIT, and analyzing the results. The survey consisted of physical forms placed at exits and digital forms hosted on Google Forms. We targetted students, faculty, and staff that
									work or attend OIT. My motivation for choosing this project was personal as I had many things I believed could be improved at OIT but wanted to see if other students supported improvements as well. The results from this survey will be used by the Wellness Committee to improve campus.
									</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Results</h2>
									<p>
									Data was analyzed using the statistical coding language R. Results showed that students and faculty/staff had differing concerns. For example, students had a large concern about on-campus food quality and on-campus gym operation hours, whereas, faculty/staff were more concerned about 
									availability/time to be able to go to events. The results were then formed into a visually appealing document and presented to the Oregon Tech wellness committee.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Significance</h2>
									<p>
									I believe that the results will help guide the Wellness Committee on certain aspects of wellness at OIT that can be improved upon. As of 2023, operation hours of the on-campus gym has been increased which was one of the concerns students had.

										<h1>Senior Project (Ongoing)</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/flowjo_logo.png" alt="FlowJo LLC Logo" /></span>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
									<p>
									My senior project is in collaboration with FlowJo LLC. The goal for me is to create a module for their FlowJo cell software that utlizises machine learning imagery to act as a "checker" of manual user selection and to create automatic selection for users.
									The motivation behind this project is to streamline the process and to create less bias/variability in user input/selection by creating automatic methods. This will hopefully make analysis for FlowJo users quicker and easier.
									</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Results</h2>
									<p>
									Final product and results are in progress.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Significance</h2>
									<p>
									By creating an automatic tool for users, it will lower bias/variability, create a standardized ground truth, and hopefully lower costs.
