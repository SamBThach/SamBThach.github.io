										<h1>Research Project 2021 to 2022</h1>

									<h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
									<p>I worked as a research assistant in the Computer Systems Engineering Technology department at the Oregon Institute of Technology. I was given two choices of research project and decided to choose one focused on higher education recruitment.
									The project consisted of creating six word clouds for six computing majors at OIT and having students participate in a web game. In this web game, students matched up the word clouds to the computing major. My motivation behind this was a personal one
									since I had changed majors in my sophmore year due to not understanding what my previous major entailed.

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Results</h2>
									<p>We had a total of 26 participants out of a total 97 recruited.  Students who participated had the most difficult time distinguishing majors that were within the same department. For example,
									The Computer Systems Engineering Technology Department had three of the six majors and were the lowest scores at 27%, 23% and 38%. This is compared to other majors such as applied mathematics with a score of 73%.
									This showed me that computing majors within one department are most difficult for students to distinguish due to many overlapping courses that translate to the word clouds as overlapping words.

									<h2>Significance</h2>
									<p>Since students have difficulty distinguishing similar majors, I have determined a course of action to alleviate this. Course descriptions should use laymen terms that incoming students understand rather than complex words that only those who have taken the courses understand.
									Course Descriptions should also have as few overlapping terms as possible. The issue with this approach is that many majors have overlapping courses which make it difficult to limit the number of overlapping terms.

										<h1>Junior Project 2021 to 2022 (In Progress)</h1>
									</header>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
									<p>My Junior Project invovled going through IRB, creating and deploying a survey for the Wellness Committee at OIT, and analyzing the results. The survey consisted of physical forms placed at exits and digital forms hosted on Google Forms. We targetted students, faculty, and staff that
									work or attend OIT. My motivation for choosing this project was personal as I had many things I believed could be improved at OIT but wanted to see if other students supported improvements as well. The results from this survey will be used by the Wellness Committee to improve campus.

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Results</h2>
									<p>Analysis of the results is still in progress.

									<h2>Significance</h2>
									<p>Analysis of results is still in progress but I believe that the results will help guide the Wellness Committee on certain aspects of wellness at OIT that can be improved upon.
