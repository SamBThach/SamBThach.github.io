										<h1>Student Campus Safety Lead</h1>
									</header>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/oregon_tech_logo.png" alt="Oregon Tech Logo" /></span>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>
									I have been on student campus safety at OIT since 2019. This position's responsibilites are to work parking duty during events and patrol during weekly nightshifts. Patrols were mainly held at night and with one coworker. In 2020, most of our workers had graduated or left. This lead to many issues with scheduling in the following year.
									</p>									
									<p>
									In 2021, I was assigned as the new lead of student campus safety and given new responsibilities in addition to old ones. One new one was to help hold hiring interviews. The second new responsibility was to schedule student worker's shifts. With a new wave of new employees and a lack of senior employees, I had to train most of the new employees. 
									In 2022, student campus safety had an issue that lead to most student workers leaving for other positions or graduating. To avoid future occurences, the start of 2023 had me write up a new student worker contract that outlined student worker responsibilities and their rights (sick leave, pay, etc.).
									</p>
									<p>
									My favorite thing about being a part of campus safety is my coworkers. My coworkers at campus safety are very kind and enjoyable to be around. Most shifts are done in a pair so being able to talk to someone that I like is a must.

										<h1>Research Assistant</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/research_poster2.png" alt="Research Poster" /></span>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>In March of 2020, I was offered a research assistant position by a professor in the Computer Systems Engineering Technology Department at Oregon Tech. I was tasked with using word clouds to collect information from students' knowledge about computing majors offered at Oregon Tech. 
									To complete this task, I created a web-based matching game using word clouds that were generated using web scraped words of the course descriptions of computing majors. We then had incoming freshman, whose listed major was a computing major, complete the game. 
									The data was then analyzed by myself in the statistical software Jamovi. I was then tasked with writing a research paper using the results and creating a presentable research poster. My research advisor then signed me up for the Special Interest Group Computer Science Education Student Research Competition.
									In 2022, when the competition arrived, I presented my results virtually and had my paper published in the Association of Computing Machinery's library.
									</p>
									<p>
									My favorite part about working as a research assistant was learning the difficulty and the ropes of having surveys published. I went through the Institutional Review Board process to have my survey approved and learning about the ethics behind research was very interesting.
									</p>
									<p>
									I also would love to redo this research project with my current knowledge. When I started this project, I was starting as a second year at Oregon Tech and lacked a lot of knowledge and work ethic that I do now. For example, I had originally conducted statistical analysis with the assumption that 
									I could manipulate the data as if it were numerical when it was actually categorical. If I were to redo this project now, I would do this project completely differently.

										<h1>Student Tech Ambassador</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Admissions_team.jpg" alt="Admissions Team Members Group Photo" /></span>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>In March of 2022, I was brought onto the student ambassador team at Oregon Tech's admissions office. My responsibilities included general office work, answering prospective students' questions, assiting with admissions events, and giving tours. A few events that I worked in my beggining months were admission's registration events
									which were called "New Wings". During these events, I assisted students with registering for classes and held campus tours. In the latter half of summer 2022, I had taken a leave of absence to work at LPG but returned in January of 2023 but was plagued with many health issues. 
									It wasn't until June of 2023 that I, again, committed myself to the tech ambassador role. I did so by working our Graduation event and our New Wings registration events. I am unfortunately taking another leave of absence due to mental health issues and comittment to my other positions on campus.
									</p>
									<p>
									My favorite part of being a part of the admissions team is giving tours. I enjoy giving tours to prospective students since I get to interact with new people who are taking their education and future seriously. I also get to tell people fun facts and knowledge about the Klamath Falls Oregon Tech campus that the prospective student 
									may not ever know otherwise.

										<h1>Litigation Practice Group</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/debt.webp" alt="Image of Debt" /></span>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>
									I was briefly a full-time employee of Litigation Practice Group. In summer of 2022, I was brought on as a member of LPG via reccomendation of my sister and worked remotely. My responsibilities were to assign tasks from a backlog of client correspondence and to submit client provided creditor documentation to client profiles. 
									I ended up leaving LPG a few weeks into september due to academic scheduling conflicts.
									</p>
									<p>
									My favorite part about working at LPG was the remote nature of the job. I enjoy working remotely if it is an option and LPG provided.

										<h1>Supplemental Instructor</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/oregon_tech_logo.png" alt="Oregon Tech Logo" /></span>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>
									In fall/winter of 2022, I approached a few of the math faculty at Oregon Tech and was requested to be an SI. I accepted the offer and began working as an SI in a lower capacity. I started off with just grading homework for math classes and hosting tutoring sessions until June 2023.
									When October 2023 began, I extended my responsibilities to assist during class time by answering student questions and assisting with student group practices. As of today, this is where I stand.
									</p>
									<p>
									My favorite part of working as a supplemental instructor is being able to connect with the math professors and the feeling of being helpful. I enjoy talking to and helping my professors since they are very kind to me and other students so I respond with the same kindness. 
									My other work experiences at the Oregon Tech campus never directly had me helping a student and seeing the results. My supplemental instructor position, on the other hand, has me directly helping students who I can see succeeding before my eyes. The feeling of helping others and seeing the results
									is something I value very much.
